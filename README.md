🛍️ Homepage with product listings (from FakeStore API)

📄 Individual product detail pages

🛒 Add to cart + localStorage cart management

📱 Responsive UI with Amazon-like navigation and footer

☁️ Hosted on AWS S3 and served globally using CloudFront

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML/CSS/JavaScript – for building the frontend

Supabase – for authentication and backend-as-a-service

FakeStore API – for mock product data

AWS S3 + CloudFront – for static site hosting and global distribution

📝 Notes
This was a learning project to understand basic web development, authentication, and AWS hosting. The UI is inspired by Amazon but simplified for practice.
